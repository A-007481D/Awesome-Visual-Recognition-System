Facial recognition is a biometric solution that measures unique characteristics about one’s face. Applications available today include flight checkin, tagging friends and family members in photos, and “tailored” advertising.

To perform facial recognition, you’ll need a way to uniquely represent a face. In 1960, Woodrow Bledsoe used a technique involving marking the coordinates of prominent features of a face. Among these features were the location of hairline, eyes and nose.

In 2015, researchers from Google released a paper, FaceNet, which uses a convolutional neural network relying on the image pixels as the features, rather than extracting them manually. It achieved a new record accuracy of 99.63% on the LFW dataset.

**FaceNet:** In the FaceNet paper, a convolutional neural network architecture is proposed. For a loss function, FaceNet uses “triplet loss”. Triplet loss relies on minimizing the distance from positive examples, while maximizing the distance from negative examples.
